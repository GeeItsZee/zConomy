# zConomy
zConomy is an economy plugin for Spigot servers that depends on `Vault` and `DbShare`.
zConomy uses a connection pool to improve performance while remaining fast and accurate when
being used on multiple servers that need synchronized economies. Additionally, the 
configuration file gives a lot of control on how economy information is displayed.
